# NotesApp
The quickest and dirtiest note taking app I have ever written

## How it Works
When the user saves the notes, I send off the current html on the page and store it in a file. Obviously this is slow and very prone to security issues, but I really needed to create something fast. 

## Goals
* Cornell Style
* "Handwriting"
* Text to speech
